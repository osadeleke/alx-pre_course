Directory Name: 0x01-git
Directory Description: In this directory, I used the terminal to
- Create a directory with mkdir
- Use echo to input text into a new file.
- Create multiple directories using mkdir on the same line of code on the terminal.
- Use vi to open a new file and edit the content in terminal.
- Add to git (git add), Commit to git (git commit) and Push to git (git push).
- Create branch and switch/checkout to branch (git checkout -b)
- Switch between branches on the terminal (git switch OR git checkout)
- Get the changes made to a branch locally (git pull)
- Merge branches (git merge)
- Resolve merge conflict (finding the conflicted file and editing the conflict file)
- Createa hidden file (file with a period "." at the beginning is a hidden file)
- Define a rule never to push in the .gitignore file.
